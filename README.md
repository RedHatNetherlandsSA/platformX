*The Gist: What is this Application?*

This is a flexible, visual tool designed to help you create and organize learning catalogues or any hierarchical information. It's built as a standalone mind map, which means:

It's Your Personal Copy: All data is saved directly to your web browser's localStorage. Your changes are private to you and will only appear on the computer and browser you are using.

Offline-Friendly: Because it saves locally, you don't need an internet connection to edit your mind map once the page is loaded.

Fully Editable: Every part of the mind map, from the main tracks down to the smallest detail, can be customized on the fly.

How to Use It: A Quick Guide

You can interact with the mind map in several ways:

Edit Any Text: To change the name of a track, level, or any field on a card, simply click on the text and start typing.

Expand & Collapse Sections:

Click on a main track (like "Developer") to show or hide its levels (101, 201, etc.).

Click on a level (like "101") to show or hide the detailed sub-level cards underneath it. Only one level per track can be open at a time to keep the view clean.

Add New Items:

Add a New Level: Click the green + button on a main track (e.g., "Developer") to add a new level (e.g., "501").

Add a Detail Card: Click the green + button on a level (e.g., "101") to add a new, detailed card below it.

Add a Custom Field: On any detail card, click the bottom + button to add a new, custom field with an editable label and value.

Remove Items:

Click the red - button on any level, detail card, or custom field to remove it permanently.

All of your changes are saved automatically as you make them.
